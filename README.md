# Stock Market Predictor

A machine learning model that has been trained to predict if the closing price of s&p500 stock will be higher or lower tomorrow. it uses a random forest classifier model that has been trained on old s&p500 data. the model still only has like a 57% precision score so its not THAT good right now. you can check out the model by downloading the source code and running the code cells in the `main.ipynb` file.
